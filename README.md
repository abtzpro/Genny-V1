This script defines a list of potential security events and impact levels, and then generates a random security insight by choosing a random event and impact level. This can be useful for generating new security insights on a regular basis, or for training machine learning models to detect and classify security events. You can customize the list of security events and impact levels to match your specific needs and use cases.
